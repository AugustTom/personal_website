# Welcome to My Personal Portfolio Website!

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Auguste, and this is the codebase for my very own slice of the internet: my personal website. 
It's supposed to be a mix of an online resume and a place for me to experiment. Have fun and feel free to hit me up if you have any questions!

## Quick Introduction

My website is a single-page application that's as snappy as a fresh carrot. It's where I showcase my most proud achievements, skills that I've honed, and projects that I've tinkered with. It's built with love, caffeine, and a bit of code magic.

## Tech Stack

Here's what's under the hood:

- **React.js** - For a dynamic and responsive user experience
- **CSS** - For styling that makes the content pop

No fluff, no complexityâ€”just a clean, modern web presence that talks about my professional life.

## Highlights

- **Concise and Pretty Design:** Easy on the eyes and fun to interact with.
- **Project Showcase:** A  selection of my projects.
- **About Me:** A quick introduction to my professional background and skills.

## Setting Up Shop

If you're curious about how it's all put together or want to run it locally, here's how you get started:

```zsh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/AugusteTomaseviciute/personal_website.git

# Go into the repository
cd personal_website

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

Now, it should be up and running on http://localhost:3000 â€” pretty easy, right?

There's also a function to deploy it to the cloud - but that's protected from the world.

## How to Navigate
You can view the live site at https://augustetom.com/, but if you love digging into code, all the action happens in the src folder. Components, styles, assetsâ€”it's all there for you to explore.

## How to Contribute
Hmmm... Not sure if you to contribute. But hey, I'm not here to stop you, just open a PR :)

## The Legal stuff
This project is released under the MIT License, which means you can use the code here for pretty much anything, as long as you credit me. It's all about sharing knowledge and growing together.

## Say hello
